# Project-0: "I can't even.." 

**Introduction**

Hi!

Thanks for checking out my game! 

When I was in elementary school and learning how to type, I used to love playing this game called "Number Crunchers" in computer class. It was simple but yet stimulating, and a great way to learn about prime numbers. Through this game, I hope to recreate and share that  experience with you. Enjoy!!
